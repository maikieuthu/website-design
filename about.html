<p>When The Body Shop first opened its doors in 1976, it was a little green-painted shop in the streets of Brighton, England. Its approach to beauty was radically different to the big players in the beauty industry. It was simple – ethically sourced and naturally-based ingredients from around the world, in no-nonsense packaging you could easily refill. Products and beauty rituals made for every body, that made women feel good in their skin 
   - never promising to make them look like someone else. <br> <br> Over 40 years ago, this kind of approach was ahead of the curve. With Anita's passion for the planet and campaigning for causes, The Body Shop was always more than just a beauty brand. It had purpose – profit and principles working in harmony. Our products were never tested on animals and didn’t exploit anyone in making them. We worked fairly with farmers and suppliers, and helped communities thrive through our Community Fair Trade programme. Today, there are more and more brands 
   following in our footsteps, and we're glad to welcome them aboard. The world needs it</p>
